Build a cross-platform mobile application called MarineTrack, designed for fishermen, seafarers, and small vessel operators to enhance safety, communication, and sustainable fishing at sea.

🎯 App Objective

MarineTrack helps users track vessels in real time, receive weather alerts, send emergency SOS signals, and discover smart fishing zones — all from a single, intuitive mobile platform.

The app must work offline-first, support real-time map tracking, and have a minimal, ocean-inspired interface for easy use at sea.

🧭 Core Features and Screens
1. Splash & Onboarding

Animated MarineTrack logo with ocean wave animation

3 onboarding slides explaining:

“Track your vessel in real-time”

“Stay safe with weather alerts”

“Send SOS instantly when in danger”

“Get Started” button → redirects to login

2. Login & Registration

Email or phone number login

Register new account with:

Name

Vessel name / ID

Role: Fisherman, Vessel Operator, or Authority Contact

Use Firebase Authentication or Supabase Auth

3. Main Dashboard (Live Map)

Interactive marine map centered on user location

Display nearby vessels (as icons or markers)

Show live GPS coordinates

Weather overlay with icons (rain, wave, wind direction)

Top info bar:

Temperature, wind speed, wave height

Floating action buttons:

⚠️ Weather Alert

🚨 SOS Emergency

🎣 Smart Fishing Zone

💬 Chat / Messages

Tech Recommendation:
Use Mapbox SDK, Leaflet, or Google Maps API for the map view.

4. Weather & Navigation

Real-time marine weather data from OpenWeatherMap or StormGlass API

Daily and hourly forecast view

Alerts for storms, strong winds, and unsafe navigation zones

Suggested safe routes (visual path overlay on the map)

5. SOS / Emergency

Large red “Send SOS” button at center

On tap:

Sends GPS coordinates, vessel ID, and timestamp

Notifies registered authority contact via push notification or SMS

Triggers alert sound confirmation

Offline mode: if connection is lost, store alert and send once reconnected

6. Smart Fishing Zone

Map overlay highlights:

🟢 Green: Recommended high-yield fishing zones

🔴 Red: Restricted or protected zones

Displays “Best Fishing Time” (based on tide + temperature data)

Uses data analytics (mock or real) for location-based suggestions

7. Communication / Chat

One-to-one or group chat between registered vessels or family contacts

“Last seen” location info for each contact

Option to send short text or audio note

Uses Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for messaging

8. Settings & Profile

Edit user/vessel info

Add emergency contacts

Choose notification preferences

“Sustainable Fishing Tips” section:

Short articles or infographics promoting eco-friendly fishing

⚙️ App Functionality & Behavior

Offline-First: Cache last known location and weather updates

Real-Time Sync: Live map and message updates using Firebase Realtime Database or WebSocket

Notifications: Push alerts for weather warnings and SOS responses

Data Storage: Store user, vessel, and location history in database

Dark & Light Mode for visibility under sunlight and night use

🎨 Design & UI Guidelines

Theme: Ocean blue, deep navy, and white accents

🧩 Output Expectations

The AI should:

Generate all app screens (wireframes/UI)

Create navigation flow between pages

Define database schema for users, vessels, messages, and SOS logs

Produce sample mock data for demo (vessel coordinates, weather alerts)

Generate prototype-ready components or Flutter/React Native code

End goal: A functional MarineTrack mobile app prototype — simple, intuitive, and reliable for maritime users to ensure safety, communication, and sustainability at sea.
