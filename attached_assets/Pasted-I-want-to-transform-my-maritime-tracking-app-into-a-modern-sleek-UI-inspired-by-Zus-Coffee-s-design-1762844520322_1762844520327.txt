I want to transform my maritime tracking app into a modern, sleek UI inspired by Zus Coffee's design language. 

**Current App Structure:**
- React Native/Expo app with tab navigation
- Features: Vessel tracking, weather, chat, SOS, notifications, ports
- Backend: Node.js server with JSON data storage
- Components: Maps (Leaflet, Waze), vessel cards, weather widgets

**Design Requirements (Zus Coffee Style):**

1. **Color Palette & Theme:**
   - Primary: Warm coffee browns (#4A2C2A, #6B4423)
   - Secondary: Cream/beige tones (#F5E6D3, #E8D5C4)
   - Accent: Burnt orange (#D97757) for CTAs
   - Dark mode: Deep espresso tones with warm undertones
   - Use gradients subtly (cream to light brown)

2. **Typography:**
   - Headers: Bold, modern sans-serif (Poppins/Inter Bold)
   - Body: Clean, readable (Inter Regular, 14-16px)
   - Hierarchy: Clear size distinction (H1: 28px, H2: 22px, Body: 16px)

3. **UI Components to Redesign:**

   **A. Home Screen (index.tsx):**
   - Hero section with gradient background
   - Featured vessel cards with rounded corners (16px radius)
   - Quick action buttons (circular, icon-based)
   - Weather widget with glassmorphism effect
   - Recent activity feed with card-based layout

   **B. Vessel Cards (VesselCard.tsx):**
   - Image with overlay gradient
   - Status badge (top-right, pill-shaped)
   - Info: Name, location, speed in clean grid
   - Shadow: soft, elevated (0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08))
   - Hover/press: slight scale animation (1.02x)

   **C. Tab Bar (_layout.tsx in tabs):**
   - Bottom navigation with icons + labels
   - Active state: filled icon + color change
   - Inactive: outline icons, muted color
   - Safe area padding
   - Subtle separator line on top

   **D. Maps (LeafletMap.tsx, WazeVesselMap.tsx):**
   - Custom markers with coffee cup icons
   - Info windows with card-style design
   - Rounded map container with shadow
   - Control buttons: floating, circular, shadowed

   **E. Weather Widget (WeatherWidget.tsx):**
   - Card with gradient background
   - Large temperature display
   - Icon + condition in row layout
   - Forecast chips (horizontal scroll)
   - Padding: 20px, border-radius: 16px

   **F. Chat Interface (chat.tsx):**
   - Messages: rounded bubbles
   - Sent: align right, primary color
   - Received: align left, light gray
   - Input: rounded, elevated, with send button
   - Timestamps: subtle, below messages

   **G. Notifications (notifications.tsx):**
   - List with card items
   - Icon on left, colored circle background
   - Title + description + time
   - Swipe actions: mark as read/delete
   - Unread: subtle accent color border

4. **Layout & Spacing:**
   - Container padding: 16-20px
   - Card spacing: 12-16px vertical gap
   - Consistent 8px grid system
   - White space: generous, not cramped
   - Max width: 480px (centered on tablets)

5. **Interactions & Animations:**
   - Button press: scale down to 0.96
   - Card tap: subtle shadow increase
   - Loading: skeleton screens with shimmer
   - Transitions: 200-300ms ease-out
   - Pull to refresh: custom coffee-themed indicator

6. **Specific Screens to Update:**

   **Onboarding (onboarding.tsx):**
   - Full-screen slides with illustrations
   - Progress dots at bottom
   - Skip button (top-right)
   - Get Started CTA (bottom, prominent)

   **Auth Screens (login.tsx, register.tsx):**
   - Centered form with logo
   - Inputs: rounded, with icons

   - Toggle switches: custom styled
   - Profile header: card with avatar
   - Logout: red, at bottom

7. **Accessibility & Polish:**
   - Touch targets: minimum 44x44px
   - Color contrast: WCAG AA compliant
   - Loading states: consistent
   - Error handling: friendly messages with retry
   - Empty states: illustration + helpful text

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use React Native StyleSheet with shared theme constants
- Create reusable component library in components/ui/redesign
- Implement dark mode support using useColorScheme
- Optimize images: use WebP, lazy loading
- Add haptic feedback for key interactions
- Ensure smooth 60fps animations

**Priority Order:**
1. Home screen & tab bar
2. Vessel cards & detail view
3. Maps with custom styling
4. Auth screens
5. Weather & notifications
6. Chat interface
7. Settings & profile
