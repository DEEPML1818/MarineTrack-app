Navigation HUD and micro-interactions
• 	Top HUD: concise ETA, distance-to-next-maneuver, and current speed/status in compact pills.
• 	Bottom card: step-by-step sea instructions (leg name, distance, recommended heading/speed) as swipeable cards.
• 	Turn/alter prompts: large, single-line instruction with a bold icon and compact secondary detail (e.g., “Pass buoy G3 to starboard — 1.2 nm”).
• 	Use subtle motion: animated progress along route, smooth pan/rotate to vessel heading, and micro-interactions (tap-to-expand cards, swipe-to-dismiss alerts).

Reports, alerts, and community signals
• 	Reporting UI: single big + button that opens a concise modal (preset types, one-tap severity, optional photo). Auto-fill location and suggested wording.
• 	Alerts: toast-style alerts for validated hazards; persistent badges on the map for unconfirmed reports. Color-code by confidence.
• 	Social cues: small numeric badges for crowd density in an area and quick-reply templates for confirmations (e.g., “Confirm debris at G3”).

Distinguishing details to avoid legal/design conflicts
• 	Avoid using Waze’s exact icons, mascots, color palette, unique layout proportions, or copy lines.
• 	Do not replicate their map label styles, exact button placements, or trademarked wording.
• 	Create your own mascot or visual motif (maritime-inspired) and use original phrasing for prompts and microcopy.
• 	Make the map water-following behavior and sea-specific phrasing central—this helps differentiate the product functionally and visually.

Implementation checklist (developer-friendly)
• 	Build map style variants (day/night) and layer toggles.
• 	Implement vessel marker with heading-follow camera and smooth interpolation between AIS updates.
• 	Route rendering: main track (solid glowing line), alternatives (dashed), and leg markers (buoys/waypoints).
• 	HUD components: ETA pill, next-leg card, report button.
• 	Animations: route progress, toast alerts, swipe gestures.
• 	Accessibility: large tap targets, high-contrast labels, and scalable text.

Quick copy examples (tone + UI)
• 	ETA pill: “ETA 14:35 — 3.2 nm”
• 	Next-leg card: “Fairway Alpha — 12.3 nm; Pass buoy G3 to starboard”
• 	Report button tooltip: “Report hazard — one tap”
